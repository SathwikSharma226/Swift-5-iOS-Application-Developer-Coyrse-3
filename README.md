Tables, Data &amp; Networking in iOS

In this course you will learn how to work with data in iOS.  Data is the key ingredient for any functional app and one must learn how to properly display it to the user.  You will learn how to use tables and collection views to display data to users, and how to use Core Data to build more robust, data-driven applications.

Every app must have data.  Making web requests is by far the most common thing you will do as an iOS developer.  You will learn how to get your apps working with servers and external data. Throughout the course, you will create a ToDo app, including learning how to decode data from a web server as well as how to make POST requests.
